# CODE-NOTEBOOK-JAVA

The database of the code book I made before was registered in localhost on the sql server. When my operating system crashed, the data I previously saved is gone. So I decided to build a portable code book to store your code. Based on the phrase "Yaz Write Once Run Anywhere", I decided to write in java. I developed a fast-running algorithm in my program. I developed my project in java form using Netbeans and object oriented programming.
